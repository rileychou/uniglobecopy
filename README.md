# Remarque
For most people, school is just a place where they get educated and have friends. However, for youth dealing with abusive families, school is often the only option to take a break from all the pain. With the shelter-in-place order continuing to extend as time goes on, these kids are only going to keep suffering with no escape. This project is intended to relieve some of that stress, make friends, and encourage them to seek help.
