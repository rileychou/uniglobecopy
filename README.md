# Remarque
For most people, school is just a place where they get educated and have friends. However, for youth dealing with abusive families, school is often the only option to take a break from all the pain. With the shelter-in-place order continuing to extend as time goes on, these kids are only going to keep suffering with no escape. This project is intended to relieve some of that stress, make friends, and encourage them to seek help. 

## Features
Here are the main features of Remarque!
### Info
a page where users can look for help from professional organizations working to help kids like them. 
### Minigames
video games are great ways to relieve stress, which is why we incorporated those for people who need to distract themselves
### Chat
we wanted people to be able to connect with people who can help or are going through similar issues as them
