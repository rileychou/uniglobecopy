      <p>Here at Notite, our goal is to create a safe space so children will never feel alone, especially in this time of crisis. 
      Not everyone has that trusted adult to talk to, and here, we are there to help you out. Whatever it is you are going through, we can help. <br>
      This pandemic has caused people to lose touch with other people around them, which is why Notite has a chat feature so kids can talk to 
      other kids and socialize, something they have lost due to the virus. <br />
      Many kids have too much on their mind. They are scared, alone, and are in a state of fear of what comes next. That is why the game feature helps children
      take their mind of all of those things and just lose themselves in these arcade style games. No youngster should ever have as much on their mind as
      today's youth, and we are here to change that.
