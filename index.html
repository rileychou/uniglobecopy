        Here at Remarque, we realize that home is not necessarily a safe place for everyone.
        The COVID-19 pandemic forces many people to stay under the same roofs with their abusers.
        Remarque wants to provide a safe home for youth, no matter where you are in the world.

          As a teenager who is facing a bunch of problems recently, this website calmed me down as I played their
          interesting minigames.
          College admissions overwhelmed me, and the first thing I had in the morning was not a warm breakfast - it's a
          panic attack after my parents' scolding last night.
          This website teaches me to care myself more and take time to chill sometimes - as it is important to take
          breaks from time to time because I am not a machine.
          The calming theme of this website ignited a very dim light of hope, urging myself to get up and start working
          again. Thank you for creating this website!

          I've used this website nearly everyday after i was introduced to it!
          It really makes me a bit less lonely and happy that theres such a platform for people that may be going
          through the same issues I am.
          The games are super fun and there are also resources and ways to talk to people which i extremely enjoy doing
          :)
