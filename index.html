        Here at remarque, we realize that home is not necessarily a safe place for everyone.
        The COVID-19 pandemic forces many people to stay under the same roofs with their abusers.
        Remarque wants to provide a safe home for youth, no matter where you are in the world.

        As a teenager who is facing a bunch of problems recently, this website calmed me down as I played their interesting minigames. 
        College admissions overwhelmed me, and the first thing I had in the morning was not a warm breakfast - it's a panic attack after my parents' scolding last night. 
        This website teaches me to care myself more and take time to chill sometimes - as it is important to take breaks from time to time because I am not a machine. 
        The calming theme of this website ignited a very dim light of hope, urging myself to get up and start working again. Thank you for creating this website!

        i've used this website nearly everyday after i was introduced to it! 
        It really makes me a bit less lonely and happy that theres such a platform for people that may be going through the same issues I am. 
        The games are super fun and there are also resources and ways to talk to people which i extremely enjoy doing :)
